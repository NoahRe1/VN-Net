# VN-Net: Unleashing the Potential of Sparse Spatio-Temporal Meteorological Forecasting via Visual-Numerical Fusion in Graph Neural Network

This is the official PyTorch implementation of VN-Net.



## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Preparation



## Training

Taking the temperature prediction for the Northeast region as an example, use the following command to train the model:

```bash
python train.py --config_filename configs/mlvfem_degcn_lgvnfm/d60_temp.yaml
```
